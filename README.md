data and statistical code for Bach et al. "The dynamic life of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal symbionts" submitted to Ecology

Data collected in summer 2012 from the Comparison of Biofuel Systems (COBS) experiment near Slater, Iowa (41°55'14.42"N, 93°44'58.96"W).  COBS is a randomized complete block design with four replicates containing 27 m x 61 m plots (Fig. 1a).  The present study includes three of the experimental agroecosystem treatments:  no-till continuous maize (Zea mays, corn), planted tallgrass prairie, and fertilized planted tallgrass prairie.  Additional site details can be found in:

One each sampling date, four soil cores (2 cm diameter x 10 cm deep) were collected and combined for each plot.  Roots were removed from soil, cleaned, and stained with Trypan blue to enhance visibility of arbuscular mycorrhizal structures.  Stained roots were observed under 40x magnification.  Presence of vesicles and hyphae were evaluated by the point interestect method, counting presence of such structures at each point a root crossed a gridded petri dish.
